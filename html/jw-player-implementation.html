<!-- Replace RTMP-DISTRIBUTION-DOMAIN-NAME with the domain name of your 
RTMP distribution, for example, s5678.cloudfront.net (begins with "s").

Replace VIDEO-FILE-NAME with the name of your .mp4 or .flv video file, 
including the .mp4 or .flv filename extension. For example, if you uploaded 
my-vacation.mp4, enter my-vacation.mp4. You might need to prepend "mp4:" to the 
name of your video file, for example, mp4:my-vacation.mp4.

If the file is in a subdirectory, include the subdirectory name just before 
the file name, for example:

"rtmp://RTMP-DISTRIBUTION-DOMAIN-NAME/cfx/st/sample-directory/VIDEO-FILE-NAME"
